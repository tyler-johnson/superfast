# Superfast
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tyler-johnson/superfast.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tyler-johnson/superfast)

Superfast is a JavaScript framework for rapidly creating single-page, isomorphic web applications.

This is the CLI tool for managing a local Superfast application. With this you can:

- Create new Superfast application.
- Run a local development server out of the working directory.
- Produce a production ready application bundle.

To see Superfast in action, check out the [TodoMVC example](https://github.com/tyler-johnson/superfast-todomvc-example).

> **Note**: This is still under heavy development. Please use with caution.

## Install

Use NPM to install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install superfast -g
```

Once install, you can get additional help with the CLI using the `-h` flag:

```bash
superfast -h
```
